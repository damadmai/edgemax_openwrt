## How it works

- It downloads
  - Ubiquiti EdgeOS 2.0.6 stock firmware with new bootloader e51_002_4c817
  - OpenWrt 18.06-snapshot-r7911 initramfs factory with small enough kernel for flashing through EdgeOS
  - OpenWrt 21.02.1 sysupgrade image
- Ensures that only one firmware image is stored on device
- Installs EdgeOS 2.0.6
- Checks bootloader version an upgrades to boodloader that enables TFTP recovery in case something goes wrong
- Installs OpenWrt initramfs factory image and then sysupgrade to current verion
- Shows if it worked
